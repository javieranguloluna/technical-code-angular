# @technical-code-angular/source

This is a TODOs technical code test in a Node.js project using Angular framework for building scalable and high-performance web applications. The project is structured with Nx workspace to provide powerful tools for code sharing and best practices enforcement.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Installation

To install the dependencies, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to view it in the browser. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist/` folder. It correctly bundles Angular in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run test:unit`

Executes the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for the Angular application and any additional libraries specified.

### `npm run test:e2e`

Executes the end-to-end tests using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). Make sure to have your application running before executing end-to-end tests.

### `npm run test:all`

Executes all test

## Dependencies

This project is built using Angular and a number of other helpful libraries and tools:

- Angular CDK and Angular Material for UI components
- RxJS for reactive programming
- Nx for workspace tooling
- Jest for unit testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing
- ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting
